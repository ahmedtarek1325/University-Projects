  # (1) Remove the high frequencies from image1 by blurring it. The amount of
  #     blur that works best will vary with different image pairs
  # generate a gaussian kernel with mean=0 and sigma = cutoff_frequency,
  # Just a heads up but think how you can generate 2D gaussian kernel from 1D gaussian kernel
  kernel = None
  
  # Your code here:
  low_frequencies = None # Replace with your implementation

  # (2) Remove the low frequencies from image2. The easiest way to do this is to
  #     subtract a blurred version of image2 from the original version of image2.
  #     This will give you an image centered at zero with negative values.
  # Your code here #
  high_frequencies = None # Replace with your implementation

  # (3) Combine the high frequencies and low frequencies
  # Your code here #
  hybrid_image = None # Replace with your implementation

  # (4) At this point, you need to be aware that values larger than 1.0
  # or less than 0.0 may cause issues in the functions in Python for saving
  # images to disk. These are called in proj1_part2 after the call to 
  # gen_hybrid_image().
  # One option is to clip (also called clamp) all values below 0.0 to 0.0, 
  # and all values larger than 1.0 to 1.0.
  # (5) As a good software development practice you may add some checks (assertions) for the shapes
  # and ranges of your results. This can be performed as test for the code during development or even
  # at production!
